roadmap
-------

Current version of raylib is quite complete and functional but there is still a lot of things I would like to improve.
Here it is a list of features I would like to add and functions to improve.

Around the source code there are some TODO points with pending revisions/bugs and here it is a list of features I would like to add.

raylib v1.x

   - [DONE] Review Billboard Drawing functions
   - [DONE] Review Heightmap Loading and Drawing functions - Load Heightmap directly as a Model
   - Lighting support (only 3d mode)
   - [DONE] Simple Collision Detection functions
   - Default scene Camera controls (zoom, pan, rotate)   
   - Basic Procedural Image Generation (Gradient, Checked, Spot, Noise, Cellular)
   - [DONE] Software mipmapping generation and POT conversion (custom implementation)

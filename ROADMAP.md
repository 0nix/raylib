roadmap
-------

First version of raylib is quite complete and functional but there is still a lot of things I would like to improve.
Here it is a list of features I would like to add and functions to improve.

Around the source code there are some TODO points with pending revisions/bugs and here it is a list of features I would like to add.

raylib v1.x

   - Review Billboard Drawing functions
   - Review Heightmap Loading and Drawing functions
   - Lighting support (only 3d mode) - CreateLight()
   - [DONE] Simple Collision Detection functions
   - Default scene Camera controls (zoom, pan, rotate)   
   - Basic Procedural Texture / Image generation (Gradient, Checked, Spot, Noise, Cellular)
   - Software mipmapping generation and POT conversion (custom implementation)
   - Comments / Functions translation (?)
   
Any feature missing? Do you have a request? [Let me know!][raysan5]
